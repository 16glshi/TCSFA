* to switch between flip-flop and sin^2 envelop, modify the files pulse.f90 (substitute the function name, modify tp = 2d0 * (nc + n_tail)* 2*pi/om (also the config.py) ) and im_propagation.f90 (comment/uncomment in the function im_action_W)
* to use complete random distribution modify the file "slave.f90"



* error messsage
** 1: cannot find saddle point
** 2: too many steps for rk4 to find convergent trajectory
** 3: final energy is less than 0
** 4: get too closed to the core
