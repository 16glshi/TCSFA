This procedure is used to study the phase variation of 4 types of trajectories

Firstly, we use the files
"read_info.f90, read_traj.f90 and reduce.f90"
to create a reduced set of data "../../dat/reduced_data.dat"
the criteria is simply
|M_p|^2 > 1e-10

Then we use the file
"partition.f90" to create a grid of the size 1600x400
output the result in the format
w1 w2 w3 w4 phi_1 phi_2 phi_3 phi_4
with z-direction running faster than x-direction
to the file "../../dat/phase.dat"
